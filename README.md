# Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes - Daily Farmbot

The main porpuse is to automate doing the daily activities and collecting the basic tokens you get from doing these activities. This is a very early version and more a proof of concept as most things are just hardcoded for my needs.

## Warning: It's not adviced to run the script on your own right now WITHOUT MAKING ADJUSTMENTS TO THE SCRIPT. It will 100% fail at some point in the script. At the moment see it more as A HEADSTART TO CREATE YOUR OWN SCRIPT.
